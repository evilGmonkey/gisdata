# My GIS Data Repository

I intend to store GIS data in here, for the most part it will be data that I have downloaded from various Open online resources and then uploaded one of my Geospatial Data repositories. The main reason for having this GIT repo is to maintain the integrity of the data I get. That is I plan to upload "improve" this data whenever I can, and what to ensure it is able to track those changes back to the original, I figure git will be good for that!
